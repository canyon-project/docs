# About Code Coverage

## What is code coverage?

Code coverage is a measurement used to express which lines of code were executed by a test suite. It has four dimensions.

- **Line Coverage**: Has every line of code been executed?
- **Function Coverage**: Has every function been invoked?
- **Branch Coverage**: Has every `if` block been executed?
- **Statement Coverage**: Has every statement been executed?


Phrased simply, code coverage provides a visual measurement of what source code is being executed by a test suite. This information indicates to the software developer where they should write new tests in an effort to achieve higher coverage.

Testing source code helps to prevent bugs and syntax errors by executing each line with a known variable and cross-checking it with an expected output.

## What does Canyon bring to the table?

Code coverage tools incentivize developers to write tests and increase coverage. During the process of writing tests, the developer may discover new bugs or syntax issues in the source code that are important to resolve before distributing the application.

Canyon specialises in end-to-end test coverage collection.JavaScript End-to-end test coverage is used to ensure code quality and functional integrity of the entire application under real user actions. It validates the application's functionality by simulating user behaviour, identifying integration issues, preventing regression errors, and helping to optimise the user experience. This coverage increases the team's confidence in code releases and ensures the stability and reliability of the application in real-world use.
