# Changed Code Coverage

To calculate changed code coverage, a baseline must be set, which can be either a `Commit SHA` or a `Branch`.


import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Configuration of the baseline can be referenced in the [Compare Target](/documentation/ecosystem/plugins/babel-plugin-canyon) configuration.
</Callout>


## Calculation

### Logic

1. Traverse all statements, functions, and branches to identify uncovered lines.
2. Use `git diff` to find newly added lines of code.
3. Determine which of the newly added lines belong to the uncovered lines.

*In short, it refers to the uncovered lines in the coverage details.*

### Formula

$\text{newline} = \frac{\text{Add number of lines - Not covered Add lines}}{\text{Add number of lines}}$
