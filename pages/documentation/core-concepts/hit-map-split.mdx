# Separate The Coverage Hit And Map Data

End-to-end testing generates a large volume of coverage data. We recommend separating `hit` from `map` data.

To achieve this, you need to:

- Configure `keepMap` as `false` in the Babel plugin.
- Report the map data in the pipeline.

## Babel Plugin Update

  ```js {3,4}
  module.exports = {
    plugins: process.env.CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME === 'test-coverage' ? [
      'istanbul',
      ['canyon', { keepMap: false }],
    ]:[],
  };
  ```

## Report map data in the pipeline

The following is an example of GitHub Actions.

For the usage of `canyon-uploader`, please refer to its [documentation](/documentation/ecosystem/tools/canyon-uploader).

```yaml copy
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: lts/*
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm i -g canyon-uploader && npm install
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Upload coverage map
        run: canyon-uploader map --dsn=https://xxx.com/coverage/map/client --provider=github

```
