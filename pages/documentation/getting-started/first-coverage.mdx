# First Coverage

## Quick Start from Template

### Deploy to Vercel

You can start by creating your own Canyon demo and deploying to Vercel by clicking the link:

</a>

### Fork the Template

You can also manually fork the
[template repository](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon-babel-template).


## Start as a New Project

<Steps>
  ### Install

  Front-end engineering and modularization cannot do without Babel. If your project is, you only need to install two Babel plugins to get started quickly.

  ```sh npm2yarn
  npm install babel-plugin-istanbul babel-plugin-canyon -D
  ```

  Add the [`istanbul`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-istanbul) and [`canyon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-canyon) plugins in [babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/config-files#configuration-file-types).
  ```js {3,4}
  module.exports = {
    plugins: process.env.CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME === 'test-coverage' ? [
      'istanbul',
      'canyon',
    ]:[],
  };
  ```
  <Callout>
    The plugin can slow down the compilation speed of the development environment, so you need to control the conditions under which the plugin takes effect.
  </Callout>

  After the configuration is completed, start the project and print **window._\_coverage\_\_** in the console. If it is the same as the following picture, then the code instrumentation is successful.

  ### CI environment variables

  In the CI environment, we need to configure some environment variables for reporting coverage data.

  1. DSN and REPORTER

  DSN: Coverage data reporting API, \{\{url\}\}/coverage/client.

  REPORTER: The user token, You can go to the user settings page to view it.

  2. Configuration of CI platform variables

  <Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
    Among them, Project ID, Branch, and SHA don't need to be configured. The canyon plugin will detect the pipeline environment variables.
  </Callout>

  ### Report the coverage data

  At this time, the coverage data is in the browser. As users operate or UI automation cases are executed, the data will keep accumulating. We need to report the data to the Canyon backend service.
