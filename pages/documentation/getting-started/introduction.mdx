# Introduction

## In a nutshell

Canyon enables JavaScript coverage data collection and real-time report generation through simple Babel configuration, addressing the challenge of coverage collection in end-to-end testing.

## Architecture

This diagram illustrates the architecture of Canyon and some components of its ecosystem:

1. The Babel plugin completes code instrumentation in the CI/CD process.
2. The project is released to the test environment. The user chooses UI automation or manual testing to trigger the instrumented code probe.
3. The generated coverage data is reported to the Canyon server.
4. The Canyon server consumes the data and combines the source code information provided by GitLab to generate a coverage report.
