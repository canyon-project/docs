Internationalization and Localization

Thank you for helping us translate the software.

## Create a New Translation

Before starting a new language translation, please check the [existing pull requests](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon/pulls) to see if anyone is already working on the translation. If you find relevant content, please join the discussion and help us keep the existing translations up to date.

If no existing translation is available, you can follow these steps to create a new one:

1. **[Fork the repository](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon/fork).**
2. **Switch to the `main` branch to get the latest translation content.**
3. **Create a new branch for your translation work, based on the `main` branch.**
4. **Create a language file for your target language in the [`/packages/canyon-platform/locales`](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon/tree/main/packages/canyon-platform/locales) directory.**
5. **Copy the contents of the source file [`/packages/canyon-platform/locales/en.json`](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon/blob/main/packages/canyon-platform/locales/en.json) into the target language file.**
6. **Translate the strings in the target language file.**
7. **Add your language entry to [`/packages/canyon-platform/languages.json`](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon/blob/main/packages/canyon-platform/languages.json).**
8. **Save and commit your changes.**
9. **Submit a pull request.**

_You can submit a pull request before completing all the steps: for example, you may need help with translations or resolving failing tests. However, your pull request will not be merged until all steps are completed._

Translating the entire site is a sizable task. One way to break it down is by creating pull requests on your fork and collaborating with other translators. You can also [add collaborators to your fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository), inviting others to directly submit to your fork and collectively manage the pull request merges.

## Update Translations

### Corrections

If you find spelling or grammatical errors, typos, or opportunities for better phrasing, please open a pull request with your suggestions. If you discover an issue but are unsure or don't have time to fix it, please [open an issue](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon/issues/new/choose).

### Broken Links

When testing reveals broken links, please try to fix all links in the translations. Ideally, just updating the URL of the link will suffice to avoid translation changes.
